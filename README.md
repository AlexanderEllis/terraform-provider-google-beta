The Terraform Google provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for management of GCP resources.
This provider is maintained by the [Terraform team at Google](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/partnering-on-open-source-Google-and-HashiCorp-engineers-on-managing-GCP-infrastructure.html) and the Terraform team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)

This is the ['google-beta' provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta) used for preview features and features at a beta [launch stage](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). See [Provider Versions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html) for more details on how to use `google-beta`.

Quick Starts
----------------------

- [Getting Started with the Google Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started)
- [Provider Development](docs/contributing)

Documentation
----------------------

Full, comprehensive documentation is available on the Terraform Registry:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/latest/docs

Upgrading the provider
----------------------

The Google provider doesn't upgrade automatically once you've started using it. After a new release you can run

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

to upgrade to the latest stable version of the Google provider. See the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions)
for more information on provider upgrades, and how to set version constraints on your provider.

Using the provider
----------------------

See the [Google Provider documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html) to get started using the Google provider.

Upgrading the provider
----------------------

To upgrade to the latest stable version of the Google provider run `terraform init -upgrade`. See the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions) for more information.

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp
$ git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta
$ make build
```

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org)
installed on your machine (version 1.16.0+ is *required*). You can use [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv)
to manage your Go version. You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH),
as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`.
This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin`
directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-google-beta
...
```
